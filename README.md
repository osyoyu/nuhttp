# NuHttp

A new HTTP server framework for Ruby.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/nuhttp`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

## Usage

```
require 'nuhttp'
require 'nuhttp/rack_port'

world = "World"

App = NuHttp.app do |b|
  b.get '/' do |c|
    c.res.body = "Hello, #{world}!\n"
  end

  b.get '/json' do |c|
    c.json({ message: "Hello, #{world}!" })
  end

  b.get '/users/:id' do |c|
    user_id = c.req.params[:id]
    c.json({ user_id: user_id })
  end
end

rack_app = NuHttp::RackPort.new(App)

require 'rackup'
Rackup::Server.new(app: rack_app).start
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
